            <h4>Website design</h4>
            <p>
              As a university project I was asked to create a website that
              included all the stages of a project, from research to
              development. Creating a personal porftolio website was something I
              wanted to do and I believe websites should have a purpose. The
              purpose of this website is to display my work and allow me network
              opportunities.

              <li>
                <strong>Number of website visits</strong> - This number can be
                refined with Google Analytics to evaluate at what point users
                drop off the website. This extra information can indicate
                navigation problems on the website.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Number of CV downloads</strong> - Users have on the
                ‘About’ section information about my most recent education/work
                experience, along with the option to download the full CV. This
                is relevant for users who will be viewing the website on mobiles
                with data limitations. The number of downloads will give me an
                estimate of how many users are interested in the full CV, this
                data is important in comparison with the total number of visits
                to the ‘About’ page.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Number of contacts through social media</strong> - This
                number will give an idea of the percentage of the users that
                visited my website, are interested and took the time to connect
                with me.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Number of forms submitted</strong> - As there will not
                be direct email available to contact me on the website, the only
                options the users have to contact me is through social media and
                forms submitted. Contrary to social media, users will not have
                to leave the website to contact me through the form. Giving me
                better information on how many users are interested in contact
                me against the total number of page views.

              My user research is focused on my target users, both designers and
              recruiters. As the goals of this website are creating new network
              opportunities and having access to new job offers, what I am
              looking to find out from the users is:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Understanding what users look for in a design online portfolio,

                Understand if it is useful to have a download button with a full

              <li>
                Understand in terms of people who work in the design industry
                and other designers, what kind of information they look for in
                an online portfolio,
              </li>
              <li>
                Understand if people find it useful to have a little blurb of

            <p class="longDescription">
              I have conducted my research using an online survey. This method
              was my first option, due to its nature, it is designed to be done
              without the researcher having to be present, is similar to
              interviews and can reach more users by allowing the users to
              complete the survey on their own time. I have tried to provide a
              short survey to get the maximum amount of people possible and to
              avoid them getting exhausted and dropping out.
            </p>

            <p class="longDescription">
              These two target audiences have overlapping interests, that will
              need to be present on the website, such as what tools I have used
              for a project (Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma) and what kind of
              project it was (branding, ads, user interface). This can be
              achieve tagging the projects and allowing users to search by tags.
              This makes it easier for the user to navigate through the website,
              allowing the users to only see the type of projects they are
              interested in. However, this hypothesis would have to be tested on
              a prototype stage, to see if users find it useful or not.

            <h2 id="survey">Survey and design decisions</h2>
            <p class="longDescription">
              One of the questions was trying to
              <strong
                >understand how social media can generate website
                engagement</strong
              >, for this, I have asked if users follow designers they are
              interested in on social media, 14 people said yes, however, this
              being a closed question it did not indicate where would be the
              best placement for the links. <br /><br />This based my design
              decision of having the social media links at the top of the
              contacts page, making it easier for people to see it, as well as
              having it on the footer of all the pages.
            </p>
            <p class="longDescription">
              Two questions that were directly related with the design were
              <strong
                >if users felt like a brief resume should be available without
                any download option and if there should be a download option for
                a full cv</strong
              >, the majority of the users replied yes to both. This was
              reflected on the design of the “about” page where I inserted a
              download button for the users who are interested in finding
              information about my full work and education history, but also
              made available a blurb of my most recent jobs and education for
              users who could not download the full version.

            <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
            <p class="longDescription">
              During this project, it was clear how much impact user research
              had on the overall product. The main approach used was a
              user-first approach as this is essential to make a website that
              was pleasant to the user. Usability and easy interaction were a
              key focus, people have different needs and merging those needs
              with the website goals was essential to maximise the potential new
              opportunities. It was also a reflection of a product life cycle
              and how small changes and improvements can make a big difference
              in the overall user experience.<br /><br />
              There is not a defined finish date for this project, as time goes
              on, new tools and techniques come out allowing me to collect new
              data using different tools such as google analytics. This data
              gets more and more refined with time and with the total amount of
              users increasing, allowing the website to be refined based on the
              data collected.
